            If you are a Computer Science major and don't know about Git and Github or if you've never used it before, then we suggest that you begin using them as soon as possible. We say this because in most tech companies, you will have to use Git and Github for big projects, with multiple developers. For those who don't know, Git is an open source version control system used to handle small or large projects. Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Many companies, if you're applying for internships, sometimes ask for your Github link to see what projects you've worked on or are working on. Lasty, after you familiarize yourself with some of the basic Git commands, then begin using terminal and creating branches for every project you work on, no matter the size.

            WayUp is a great platform to seek for Computer Science related internships. They also provide information on internships that are currently open. As you all know, getting an internship(s) during your college years is very important. This will enable you to possibly get a return offer once you graduate. Getting a full-time role with no prior internship experience can be a bit difficult, so preparing and getting those interviews should be something CS students should be aiming for.

            Levels Fyi is an amazing platform to look for up to date tech salaries, ranging from internships to full-time salaries. Figuring out salaries is good to know when you get to the offer stage when applying to jobs. Knowing the average salary for someone in that position and company will be useful so you can be able to negotiate for a higher salary.

            TTP Residency is a program at John Jay for Computer Science students, in which students will be able to attend a 4-week technical bootcamp. This bootcamp consists of practicing for technical interviews, learning new programming languages like Python, React, and how to prepare for your career. Lastly, probably the most exciting part about this program, is that if you are accepted into the program and complete it, there is a high probability that you will get a chance to get an internship for a tech company in New York City, during the Summer.

            CUNY Tech prep is for all CUNY schools. TP is a year long program for Computer Science students, where you'll learn in-demand tehcnologies, connect with professionals, and get help with landing great tech roles in New York City. This program also prepares you for interviews, behavioral and technical, and will help you build up your portfolio. Lastly, you will also have a mentor to guide you. This is a great program that you should think about applying to.

            As we all know, in the Computer Science field, coding plays a huge part in the development process of a project. However, during the development process, before you begin coding, you need to have some sort of layout or template of how you'd like your project to look like and it's functionality. This is where Design Tools come into play. Check out this link to get started in designing a prototype of your project if you're interested in UI/UX design.
